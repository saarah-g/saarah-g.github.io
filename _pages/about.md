Thanks for stopping by! I'm **Saarah**, a Roboticist from Coimbatore, India

I currently work for [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com) remotely from Detroit, MI. I am on on the Manipulation team for the [Stretch](https://www.bostondynamics.com/stretch) project, and am responsible for motion generation. To date, my code has helped Stretch move >6 million customer boxes.

I graduated from **PSG College of Technology**'s B.E in Robotics and Automation program! My interests include motion planning (optimization or ML based) and any kind of modeling that can improve my understanding of a system.


Aside from Robotics, I love reading books, blogging, and music!
